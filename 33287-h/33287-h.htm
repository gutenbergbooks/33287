<div class='cap'>THE National Rifle Association may
fairly claim the honour of introducing,
at their meeting in July 1885, the subject of
Military Revolver practice in this country.
For years past the want of such a movement
has been felt, but the many obstacles to be
overcome have been so vast that no one
seems to have cared to venture upon the
matter, and so it has slept.</div>

<p>The great drawback has been, and is
now, to find suitable ranges anywhere near
London. Such ranges, the use of which is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
enjoyed by our Citizen Army, are insufficient,
and the expense of keeping them up is considerable,
falling heavily upon the corps to
whom they belong.</p>

<p>The National Rifle Association, although
they offered some 40<i>l.</i> in prizes, and provided
not only revolvers but ammunition, for a
small consideration, or entrance fee, met with
but poor support; but it should be borne in
mind that this was the first year of such a
competition, and it was in consequence not
generally known of. Very little was known
of the movement till it actually took place,
and then only when noticed by the press the
day after its introduction.</p>

<p>Again, it should be remembered that the
entries were restricted to officers, warrant
officers, and petty officers, of her Majesty's
land and sea forces, and doubtless this restriction
accounted for the spare attendance.
Every Englishman belonging to the auxiliary
forces should hail with pleasure the opportunity
offered of making himself master of
this useful weapon; one that in skilled hands
is most deadly at long or short ranges, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
a thorough knowledge of the use of which
might at any moment be the means of saving
another's life from an opposing force when no
other weapon was at hand.</p>

<p>The difficulty in using even an ordinary
pistol with accuracy is, and always has been,
an acknowledged fact, as it requires great
practice to enable a man to make his mark as
a crack shot. Some men would perhaps miss
a haystack at twenty yards, while others, with
little practice, soon become excellent shots at
very small objects. It is marvellous the
accuracy with which the professional burglar
has of late years used his revolver against
the police and others; but it may be accounted
for by the fact that these men use
a small, light weapon, easily carried and
much easier wielded than the military regulation
revolver, which weighs 2 lbs. 8 oz.;
that they invariably take what may be termed
flying shots&mdash;and it should be remembered
that a full-sized man at comparatively close
quarters presents a very large target. I venture
to affirm that if these burglarious minions
of the moon, who make night hideous, were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
compelled to stand before a Martini-Smith
target (a foot square) at twenty yards, with a
military regulation revolver, they would make
but sorry marksmen.</p>

<p>The use of the military revolver is acknowledged
to be a question of great importance,
as one not only affecting those who embrace
the profession of arms, but those who travel;
and as no one knows when he may be called
upon, or where he may be, it is imperative
that he should gain a thorough knowledge of
every minor detail, most useful in the hour of
need, and which will enable him not only to
protect himself with confidence, but to come
to the assistance of the weak should occasion
require.</p>

<p>It is to be deplored that what once formed
part of the education of a gentleman&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> the
use of the small sword and broadsword&mdash;should
have been so thoroughly neglected
of late years in this country. That part of
the education of youth seems to have become
quite a secondary consideration.</p>

<p>General Sir Charles Napier has truly said,
'Young men have all the temptations in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
world to pleasure, none to study; consequently,
they some day find themselves conspicuous
for want of knowledge, not of talent.'</p>

<p>The introduction of the Breech-loader has
revolutionised firearms. When we look back
upon the extraordinary achievements of arms
during the present century, with the comparatively
crude weapons then in use as
compared with the marvellous inventions of
the present moment, it is simply astounding
what results were obtained.</p>

<p>The terrible work done by the old Brown
Bess, with its unique flint-and-steel lock of
its day, at Waterloo and elsewhere, is now
matter of history. In those days artillery
and cavalry had a chance of existence in the
field, they have scarcely any now. The old
flint lock, although it has had its day, has
done its work well, and is entitled to veneration.
Many a noble fellow has bit the dust
from its spark, and England's first and
greatest battles were fought and won by its
aid. The Nipple and Percussion Cap came
next into use, and subsequently the Breech-loader;
but since Rifles have superseded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
military smooth-bore weapons, the old
spherical ball has been condemned.</p>

<p>The breech-loading rifled arm of the
present day may be looked upon as a marvel
of modern ingenuity; as combining exquisite
manufacture, extraordinary precision, and unequalled
range. The latter may be accounted
for by the conical shape of the bullet, and the
rotary motion given thereto by the grooving
of the barrel; and lastly, from the full force
of the evolution of gas consequent upon the
powder being enclosed in a copper tube
which is inserted in the breech when loading
the piece.</p>

<p>The barrel of the Breech-loading Rifle is
by its own action of firing kept comparatively
clean, as compared with the old Muzzle-loader;
for with the breech-loader any fouling
of the barrel is driven out by the discharge,
and the powder in the cartridge is kept perfectly
free from any contamination with the
moisture adhering to the barrel by its copper
case and being inserted in the breech; whereas
in the old muzzle-loading weapon the barrel,
after the first discharge, becomes lubricated,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
and consequently a portion of the powder
poured down the barrel adhered to its moist
sides, thereby becoming deteriorated and decreasing
the explosive force. As a weapon
of precision the Snider is perhaps preferable
to the Martini-Henry; but, of course, this is
matter of opinion.</p>

<p>The sportsman of the good old school
would be somewhat astonished, and would
perhaps feel uncomfortable, upon finding
himself armed with a breech-loading fowling-piece
of the present day, particularly as
prejudices are strong and obstinacy very
prevalent among some people, and the keen
eye of the old sportsman would view the
modern innovation upon his rights&mdash;as he
would probably call them&mdash;with dread, suspicion,
and distrust.</p>

<p>It is a fact, even at the present time, that
there are many old farmers in England who
use their ancient flint-and-steel fowling-pieces
from choice in preference to modern
weapons.</p>

<p>The cool old sportsman of days gone by
would sally forth in quest of game, having<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
previously overhauled his lock, and, if necessary,
adjusted a new flint, with as much care
as an angler would examine his tackle previous
to a day's sport, as he well knew that
success depended upon vigilance and care.
There was no blustering and banging away
in those days, as soon as a bird rose, as is
unhappily too often the case now-a-days,
resulting in either blowing the bird all to
pieces or probably missing it altogether.
No, the keen eye of the old school would
coolly watch his bird rise, take a pinch of
snuff, cock his piece, cover his bird, and
then bring it down, allowing it to get well
away before drawing the trigger.</p>

<p>Many a young gentleman calling himself a
sportsman knows little of the capabilities of
the weapon he wields, and cares less; his
whole aim is to see how many head of
game he can bag, and to blaze away is
the order of the day, to the astonishment
of poor Ponto, who, if he chance to run
within range, sometimes gets a charge of
shot in his tail.</p>

<p>In the Royal Navy the use and practice of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
the pistol, and latterly of the revolver, has
always been kept up. Consequently the
Jack Tar knows more about the pistol and
the military revolver than most men give
him credit for. In boarding vessels, for instance,
the pistol was one of the arms used.
The importance of the revolver movement as
inaugurated by the National Rifle Association
has resulted in the formation of a club called
'The Metropolitan Revolver Club.' This
Club, which is in its infancy, has many
obstacles to surmount, but it is to be hoped
that the Provisional Committee will be able
to carry out the object in view, which is,
according to the programme, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="hang1">'That this Club be formed, having for its
object the provision of facilities for acquiring
a thorough knowledge of and
proficiency in the use of the Military
Revolver.'</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Dudley Wilson</span>, Esq., 2 Pall Mall, is the
Honorary Secretary, and may success attend
him.</p>

<p>To the inexperienced, the revolver is,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
perhaps, as deadly a weapon as can well be
handled; and to no class is this fact so well
known as to naval and military men. The
many deplorable accidents resulting from the
incautious handling of firearms is terrible to
contemplate; and sportsmen and military
men have frequently fallen victims to carelessness,
to say nothing of novices. The unfortunate
part is, that foolish and inexperienced
people often inflict misery upon innocent
persons; unintentionally, it is true: but
they are none the less guilty. Firearms
should be looked upon as a kind of machinery,
which no one in his senses would
attempt to handle unless he knew the use
of them.</p>

<p>The abominable practice of those to whom
firearms belong, or those in the charge or
care thereof, of keeping or leaving such
weapons loaded, so that they may at any
moment fall into the hands of children, or
perhaps, what is worse still, inexperienced
adults, is most seriously to be condemned, and
may be designated really as a criminal act,
which ought to be summarily punished.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>It is an act which has no real motive, no
real <i>bon&acirc; fide</i> object, and is lawless and idle
in the extreme,&mdash;an act which has resulted in
the death of its thousands, and the maiming
of even more.</p>

<p>A weapon should never be brought within
the portals of a man's house loaded; the
breech-loading cartridge can be easily withdrawn.
If the piece is a muzzle-loader it
should be discharged after the day's sport is
over; ammunition is really not so very costly
as to require to be husbanded at the probable
cost of a serious accident, or perhaps a fellow-creature's
life. This rule cannot be too strictly
adhered to. Some years ago it was my lot
to be staying with a gentleman of eccentric
habits, a man of violent temper, and when in
one of these fits really not answerable for his
actions. I was aware that he kept a full-sized
revolver loaded with ball, and capped,
in his dressing-room. I confess I was coward
enough to let this matter trouble me. I felt
I could stand up and face death with any one
in the field, fighting in a good cause and
armed as others; but to be taken advantage<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
of at any moment, and perhaps shot down
like a dog, was rather too much. I therefore
resolved in my own mind, not only to disarm
my friend but to render his weapon useless;
but how to accomplish this was the question,
as to raise any suspicion would perhaps bring
down wrath upon my own head. I therefore
resolved to leave everything precisely intact
till an opportunity should present itself. The
very next day the time arrived, and during
this Grand Turk's absence I hastily removed
the caps from off the nipples of the revolver,
and having exploded them upon the nipples
of his double-barrelled gun, I pinched them
back into their original shape and replaced
them on the revolver. I then put the box of
caps into my pocket and felt perfectly secure,
and could have sat and been fired at without
the slightest fear. This gentleman shortly
afterwards was seized with paralysis of the
brain, and ended his days in a madhouse.
No one, I believe, ever suffered any inconvenience
from the revolver, and what became
of it I know not.</p>

<p>If leaving weapons about is necessary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
(which I do not for a moment admit), then
most assuredly they should be rendered
harmless by being left unloaded, and thus
the means of rendering them destructive
would be kept out of the way of meddlers.
All ammunition should, as a rule, be kept in
some secret and safe place, and always under
lock and key. Every man knows that edged
tools are dangerous, consequently that the
leaving loaded firearms within the reach of
anybody who may chance to come across
them is simply leaving means of destruction
unprotected, and he should bear in mind
that this mischief of his own neglect might
accidentally at any moment be wielded
against himself.</p>

</div></div>

<p>The responsibility of those possessing firearms
is great, and proper precautions and
proper care cannot be too strictly enforced.
Care costs nothing, and may be the means of
preventing loss of life and many a deplorable
accident. The precautions necessary to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
borne in mind in the safe use of firearms for
one's own protection, as well as the protection
of others, are voluminous, and so varied are
they that it is with difficulty they can be all
dealt with in this little treatise; it is only
therefore proposed to mention some of them,
and detail a few important hints for the
guidance of the unwary. Generally speaking,
if a man will not exercise a little gumption,
care, and discretion, when in the society of a
shooting-party similarly armed as he is himself,
he must put up with the consequences.
Accidents in properly regulated families
should never happen. Since the introduction
of the breech-loader there is no excuse for
any man carrying a loaded weapon and
swinging the muzzle of it about when carrying
it on his shoulder (which is often done),
bringing every one in his rear in the line of
fire of the piece. A man can load his piece
now when he arrives upon the ground in a
moment; and should a bird rise, with the
present facilities given by the breech-loader,
there is ample time to load and bring the
bird down without the slightest difficulty.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
For any man therefore, when not in the field,
to strut about with a loaded weapon in his
possession now-a-days is simply bombastic
tomfoolery.</p>

<p>To carry a gun gracefully and properly is
an art. It should never be so carried or
wielded as to be a risk to the possessor,
or any one. The following are a few
ways how a gun should be carried:&mdash;For
safety, when commencing sport, the right
hand grasping the piece at the small of the
butt, the butt resting on the right hip or
thigh, muzzle up. The weapon can then, on
the rising of game, be at once safely presented.</p>

<p>When carried on the shoulder it should
be always with <i>lock down</i>: this mode will so
elevate the barrels that the muzzles are far
above the heads of any one; even when at
close quarters, on the march, or when approaching
or returning from cover, this way
will be found easiest and with the least
possible fatigue, as the weight of the weapon
is centered in the stock held in the right
hand. To relieve the shoulder pass the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
hand up to the small, or neck of the butt;
at the same time seize the butt with the left
hand, then raise your gun to a perpendicular
position, carry it across the body, and place
it on the left shoulder. The left shoulder
can be relieved in a similar manner, <i>i.e.</i>,
pass the left hand to the small or neck of
the butt, at the same time seize the butt
with the right hand, raise the gun to a
perpendicular position, and carry it across
the body and place it on the right shoulder.
Never present, much less fire, when any
person, whether keeper or beater, intervenes
or is near the bird. Never fire over any
one, even if he what is called 'ducks,' or
stoops to allow of your doing so. A keeper
or beater should never be encouraged in, or
allowed to 'duck' or stoop; the practice is
a bad one, and should be for ever discountenanced.
If no one fired over a ducked
body the habit would soon fall into disuse.
Sportsmen and others would do well to bear
in mind that an accident deprives the injured
man from earning his livelihood, and the poor
wife and children suffer: better to forego taking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
a shot for safety sake and let the bird escape
for another day than run any risk. This
should be made a hard-and-fast rule among
sportsmen, and a law of sport.</p>

<p>The left hand should never be placed upon
the gun till the bird has risen and <i>all is clear</i>
ahead. Coolness in the field is everything;
there should be no blundering, no hurry; a
man who knows the capabilities of his gun
can afford to be cool. He knows but too
well there is no occasion for haste; the cool
hand would pause after the bird rose, and
give it time to get fairly away before presenting.</p>

<p>A gun should never be so wielded as to
bring its barrels in line with any one, or
the barrels athwart any one. When quite a
youth I remember being in the field, when
one of the party becoming fatigued from
the effects of a tight boot handed me his
gun; the friend, who evidently did not
appreciate the confidence placed in the
youngster, kept aloof&mdash;well to the right;
presently a bird rose, I hesitated; looking
at the bird. 'Fire! Fire! why don't you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
fire, sir?' exclaimed the old gentleman with
some warmth. 'How can I,' cried I, 'with
those peasants at work right in front?' The
effect was marvellous. The old gentleman,
thoroughly appreciating the caution, at once
joined me, and I had the benefit of my full
share of the sport.</p>

<p>Firing when in thick cover and from behind
hedges should be conducted with caution, and
with a knowledge that all is clear on the
other side.</p>

<p>Little observation will show whether your
companion has been accustomed to the use
of firearms. A man of reckless temperament,
one who would blaze away blindly, a devil-may-care
sort of fellow, should be avoided;
give him a very wide berth, and keep the
gentleman well on your extreme left. If
you can shunt him altogether so much the
better. A gun should never be carried in
the field at the trail; should never be carried
under the arm, hugging the lock; should
never be carried muzzle down, so that by
an accidental slip, or stumble, or fall, the
barrels may become choked with earth (which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
would burst the muzzle if not removed before
firing); should never be carried transversely
across the body with barrels pointing left.
When shooting, a man should be as much
upon his etiquette as he would be in my
lady's drawing-room; should mind his P's and
Q's, and remember that when in a china-shop
he should refrain from carrying his
umbrella under his arm.</p>

<p>As a fact, the closing of one eye in taking
aim is unnecessary. The complete angle
of sight upon a given object can only be
obtained by the use of both eyes. Consequently
two objects cannot be seen distinctly
or clearly at the same instant, one
is clear while the others are blurred or misty;
hence it stands to reason, that in laying a gun
the top of the notch of the hindsight, the
apex of the foresight, and the object, can
be brought into line as accurately with both
eyes open as with one closed.</p>

<p>An artilleryman can lay a gun perfectly
without closing one eye. The eyes should
not be less than 12 inches from the hindsight,
if from 2 to 3 feet so much the better,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
and a more accurate aim will be the
result.</p>

<p>Upon the principle that the hand follows
the eye, a sportsman fixing both eyes upon
his bird can take as perfect an aim as he
could with one eye closed.</p>

<p>This rule applies equally to all arms.</p>

<p>A man when in the field or at practice
should keep his eyes about him; he should
remember whom he is with; that he may
be covered by a friend's gun or rifle at
any moment, and that as the abominable
and unnecessary proceeding of carrying
weapons loaded, when not actually in the
field, is the rule rather than the exception,
he may perhaps find himself accidentally
pinked at any moment, and when he little
expects it.</p>

<p>I remember some years ago the magnificent
solemnity of a military funeral was brought
to a somewhat ludicrous termination by one
of the firing party shooting his comrade in
the stern. How the accident really occurred
I never could learn; but it was a fact that
the rear-rank man managed somehow to discharge<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
his rifle, and pretty nearly blow off
the tail of his comrade's tunic.</p>

<p>The wounded man, who was more frightened
than hurt, seemed not at all to relish
the joke. An old lady came to the rescue.</p>

<p>This good old soul seems to have been in
the habit of carrying a flask, and, graciously
offering the 'pocket pistol,' suggested a drop
of the creature. The offer was most readily
accepted, but, I regret to say, the terror
of the injured man was so great that he
emptied the flask. He had evidently had
enough of soldiering and 'villainous saltpetre,'
for the very next day he sent in his
resignation.</p>

<p>At ball practice men should refrain from
talking, joking, and that ungentlemanly pastime
known as <i>horse-play</i>. Their attention
should be directed to what they are about
to do and what others are doing, and
they should leave frivolities for some other
time.</p>

<p>Many accidents in the field have occurred
when getting over stiles, gates, hurdles, stone
walls, and even through hedges.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>Within the beautiful glades of Kensington
Gardens stands a lasting memorial.</p>

<div class='bbox'>
IN MEMORY OF<br />
<big>SPEKE.</big><br />
VICTORIA, NYANZA,<br />
<small>AND THE NILE.</small><br />
1864.<br />
</div>

<p>Here is a terrible record of an awful death
through carelessness. A noble life lost, sacrificed
in a moment. Poor Speke, who had
faced death often in many forms, met it at
last by his own hand.</p>

<p>While out shooting, in getting through a
hedge he dragged his fowling-piece after him,
the muzzle towards his own body, when, the
lock becoming entangled in the brambles, his
immediate death was the result. Such a piece
of foolhardiness on the part of a man accustomed
to the use of firearms is astounding.</p>

<p>Use dulls the edge of caution, and some
men, unhappily, who are accustomed to deal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
constantly with weapons and ingredients of
destruction, become not only careless but
indifferent and callous.</p>

<p>There is a class of men who, if not kept
under surveillance, would probably be found
smoking their pipes in a powder-magazine, or
while sitting upon a barrel of gunpowder.</p>

<p>Men are too prone to carry their weapons
at full-cock. This should never be done. If
alone, when getting through a hedge or over
any <i>impedimenta</i> the weapon should be laid
on the ground, parallel with the hedge, if
possible. After getting upon the other side,
the weapon should be drawn through with
the butt end towards the person.</p>

<p>If you have a comrade or keeper with you,
hand him the weapon, muzzle up; get through
yourself, and then take the weapons from him,
<i>muzzle up</i>, and he can follow you with safety.
Always place your weapon upon half-cock (it
should never be at full-cock) before attempting
to go through a hedge or over a stile.</p>

<p>When two or more gentlemen take the
field together, it is advantageous to work the
ground in the formation of &eacute;chelon.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>The whole field will by this means be
thoroughly searched for game, and each man
can fire clear of the other, commanding his
own ground and the whole field within the
range of the respective guns.</p>

<p>When about to commence practice with
the rifle or revolver the firing party should
be placed well to the front, and should never
load, or be allowed to load, until all preliminaries
are arranged, and the words,
'Ready! go on!' are given.</p>

<p>This command or caution will, of necessity,
place every one upon his guard.</p>

<p>When the piece is loaded, the finger with
which the trigger is drawn should on no
account be placed within the trigger-guard till
the weapon is raised and the aim about to be
taken; and with the rifle until the weapon is
presented, after being put upon full-cock.</p>

<p>In firing with a pistol, or revolver, the
proper finger with which to draw the trigger
is the second finger, not the index finger, as
generally used. The index finger should be
placed horizontally along the barrel, on the
side of the weapon, which is most important&mdash;which,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
as a means of securing steadiness
and leverage, tends not only to reduce the
difficulty of the pull, but also tends to prevent
depression of the muzzle, which is sure
to take place if the forefinger is used, particularly
when the trigger has the minimum
five-pounds' pull.</p>

<p>When a gun, rifle, pistol, or revolver, is at
full-cock, and it is desired to place it upon
half-cock, as is often done, it should be
so altered, with great care, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>The hammer should be lowered gently to
the full extent of the spring, and should then
be carefully drawn back till the distinct <i>click</i>
of the half-cock is heard; then the weapon is
as safe as an arm can be when loaded, and
cannot be accidentally discharged.</p>

<p>To place a weapon from full to half-cock,
by not lowering the hammer to the full extent
of the spring, and then drawing it back
to half-cock as before described, is a most
dangerous practice, as the hammer may not
be properly inserted in the clip, and an accident
might be the result. A man once having
taken up his position at the firing-point, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
having loaded his piece, should never return
into the company of his comrades till his
piece (particularly if a pistol or revolver) is
discharged, or till all its chambers have been
expended. If it is necessary for him to
rejoin his comrades after his piece is loaded,
or after any of the chambers have been expended,
he should leave the weapon behind
him at the firing-point, and should place it,
<i>muzzle down</i>, in a hole or slot purposely made
in the table before him to receive it, which
hole in the table should have the word
'<span class="smcap">Loaded</span>' written legibly near it.</p>

<p>If there is no table, then the weapon should,
if at full-cock, be placed upon half-cock, as
before described, and then laid carefully upon
the ground, muzzle pointing towards the target,
and slightly inclined to the left thereof,
so as to be clear of it, which will allow of
the target being examined, if necessary, without
the examiner coming within the direct
line of fire of the weapon; but the table with
a hole in it is the safest method, and is
recommended.</p>

<p>A couple of stakes with a rope from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
firing-point to the target should be used, as a
precaution to keep back idle curiosity-seekers
from placing themselves within danger on the
firing party's left.</p>

<p>No one should, upon any pretence whatever,
place himself, or be allowed to place
himself, on, or even near, the firing party's
left side. The reason is obvious, as it will be
found invariably in practice that a man, when
loading with a breech-loader, will naturally
incline the muzzle of his piece, and so innocently
place those immediately upon his left
within its range.</p>

<p>If it is necessary to address a man when at
the firing-point all interlocution should be
addressed to him on his right; so the
Instructor should place himself on the right
and rather behind the practitioner, and as
close to him as convenient, so as not to incommode
his freedom.</p>

<p>Some men are naturally nervous, particularly
when at ball practice, and for this reason
all but novices should be left alone, as they
will perhaps make better scoring if not interfered
with.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>All spectators should take ground well in
rear of the alignment of the firing-point, and
on its right flank. The practice of taking up
weapons and going through the pantomime
of pointing them at the target, or pointing a
weapon at anything when not at actual
practice, is idle, and is to be condemned.</p>

<p>Weapons set aside for practice should never
be meddled with.</p>

<p>The party who takes his turn (if firing with
revolvers) should receive his weapon unloaded,
<i>muzzle up</i>, with the necessary amount of ammunition,
from the Instructor or Superintendent
in charge; he should then step to the front
or firing-point, load his piece himself, and get
rid of his cartridges as quickly as a due
regard to careful aim, &amp;c., will admit; then
return his piece, <i>muzzle up</i>, to the Instructor,
who will carefully examine it and satisfy
himself that all the chambers have been
expended.</p>

<p>Should a revolver miss fire, it is most
important that great caution should be used,
as it will sometimes '<i>hang fire</i>,' which the
cartridges of all weapons are liable to do at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
times.<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> When a cartridge does not explode
the revolver should be held in the same
position as much as possible, muzzle to the
front, or downwards, for a few seconds;
should it not then explode it may be examined,
the non-exploded cartridge removed
and condemned, and a new cartridge put in
its place. On no account should the condemned
cartridge be placed with or near live
cartridges.</p>

<p>Firearms should never, under any pretence,
be pointed at anybody; even if
unloaded, such a practice is foolish and
unpardonable. No soldier except in action
would ever think of doing so, and no gentleman
could.</p>

<p>The thoughtless practice of relinquishing
one's weapon into the hands of a friend, or,
even worse, a stranger, is against all military
rules, and in any case is strongly to be condemned,
and no excuse will palliate such an
offence; not even the assurance that the piece<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
is unloaded. A brother-comrade in the same
regiment is, perhaps, the only exception; but
even this is objectionable, except in extreme
cases. As a rule, a soldier should never
<i>relinquish</i> his piece, even to a General or
a Field Officer.</p>

<p>Firearms generally, and particularly revolvers,
when loaded or unloaded, should
never be laid upon a table so that the muzzle
can accidentally cover any one. If they must
be relinquished by the owner they should be
placed in a corner of the room farthest from
the door, leaning against the wall, muzzle
down, so that they cannot fall. If loaded
they may, when practicable, be laid upon a
side-table, muzzle towards the wall. Guns or
rifles should be stood muzzle up in their
place in the rack, or, if there is no rack, then
in a corner of the room farthest from the
door, to prevent surprise. No weapon of any
kind should be carried or put down, or left at
full-cock, and no loaded weapon should be
left unprotected. They should, if loaded, be
in the charge of some trustworthy and responsible
person; but in the time of war no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
man would be so foolish as to relinquish his
piece, either by night or by day.</p>

<p>To sportsmen and others, with the great
facilities for loading and unloading afforded
by the breech-loading system, there can be
no excuse for leaving a weapon charged
when it can so easily be rendered harmless.</p>

<p>There are many theories as to the proper
way to present a pistol or revolver.</p>

<p>Every man has some idea upon the subject,
and perhaps it would be well to leave every
one to his own devices; but at the same time
a suggestion here, as we are upon the subject,
may not be out of place.</p>

<p>The French carry the weapon muzzle up,
the lock of the piece in line with the ear.
Upon taking aim, the muzzle is gradually
depressed till the object it is desired to hit is
covered. This is no doubt a very good way;
but when firing at any distance beyond a
point-blank range it necessitates, firstly, the
depression of the muzzle to cover the object,
and secondly, the necessary elevation must be
taken so that the ball may be carried the
required distance, and so <i>hit</i> the object.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>This position of holding the weapon when
at practice commends itself on the ground of
safety.</p>

<p>The preferable way, perhaps, is the old
duelling style; that is, to hold the weapon
muzzle down at the full extent of the right
arm, standing sideways or three-quarters left,
showing as small a front as possible, the eye
to be fixed steadily upon the bull's eye or
centre of the target or object, then gradually
raising the arm to the required elevation.
Should the distance be beyond the point-blank
range, after covering the bull's eye
continue to elevate till the required elevation
is reached: by then steadily and firmly increasing
the pressure of the second finger on
the trigger the desired result will be obtained.
Suddenly drawing or jerking the trigger
should be avoided.</p>

<p>By the latter means the object is covered
at the same time as the foot of the target is
covered, so that in the event of the trigger
being drawn before the bull's eye is reached
the target will be hit, and assuming the
target to be a man he would be disabled and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
the object gained. Another important reason
for advocating the use of the second finger
in drawing the trigger is the fact that the
weight of the military revolver (2 lbs. 8 oz.),
together with the power required to draw
the trigger (5 lbs. pull), by the long tension
of the muscles of the arm, in aiming,
causes a vibration, so that the farther the
bullet has to travel the farther it is thrown
off the centre of the objective. The first
finger, therefore, placed along the barrel or
side of the pistol, acting as a lever, tends to
reduce almost to a minimum the spasmodic
muscular vibration; again, in drawing the
trigger with the forefinger the hardness of
the pull tends to depress the muzzle, while
with using the second finger as before described
this depression is almost impossible.</p>

<p>In rifle-shooting, as also in that of the
pistol and revolver, the ordinary method
should be reversed; that is, instead of commencing
at 100 yards from the target, the
practice should commence at the longest
range, and the target should be gradually
approached as if it were an actual enemy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>In revolver practice I would recommend
all who desire to become thoroughly efficient
to commence at say 100 yards from the
target, and to gradually reduce the range
to not less than 20 yards. This would
accustom the practitioner to get a thorough
knowledge of the capabilities of the weapon,
and to learn the required amount of elevation
necessary. It must be remembered that the
Military Regulation Revolver will kill at
300 yards.</p>

<p>I have myself shot with a 320-bore revolver,
eight grains of powder, bullet eighty grains,
at a regulation target at 200 yards, and have
made very fair practice: in fact, the long
range is far preferable for practice, as being
not only beneficial, but a more exciting pastime
than the ordinary range.</p>

<p>To those who do not possess a regulation
iron target, I would recommend one similar
to that which I have sometimes used. (<i>Vide</i>
diagram.) This target is made of a simple
framework of wood, covered with canvas and
layers of paper pasted thereon. It has the
double advantage of having the Martini-Smith<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
target in the centre, and the remaining
portion, having the exact size of
a man traced thereon, has one other advantage
in at once showing the result of the
practice. This target can be used over and
over again, as, after use, the perforations can
be pasted over with small pieces of paper,
and when well riddled, it can be re-covered;
and the thicker it becomes the better.</p>

<p>No one should attempt to fire ball-cartridge
anywhere but at a proper range. Firing
in small back-gardens, against brick or stone
walls and trunks of trees, should never be
allowed. Bullets will rebound or go off at a
tangent, and do serious mischief.</p>

<p>When a bullet once leaves the muzzle of a
rifle, pistol, or revolver, by the evolution of
gunpowder-gas, there is no dependence upon
it as to where it may stop, or what damage
it may do, and bullets upon hitting hard
ground will ricochet; therefore, to those who
wish to enjoy security at practice, I would
advise the selection of ground free from habitation,
or where no people are at work&mdash;some
secluded spot where there is ample range, and,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
if possible, a natural hill or mound to receive
the bullets.</p>

<p>The military revolver will kill at 300 yards,
the Snider artillery carbine at 1800 yards,
and the Martini-Henry rifle at 3000 yards.<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a>
Too much dependence upon the use of the
slide of the back-sight for elevation in rifle
practice should be deprecated for more than
one reason: <i>e.g.</i>, assuming that a man has
been firing at 300 yards with his back-sight
adjusted to that range, and he is suddenly
ordered to advance at the double; if, at the
spur of the moment, he neglects to reduce his
sight, the result will follow that every shot
will go over the enemy. It is simply idle to
suppose for one moment that in the heat of
action a soldier could afford to fritter away
valuable time, or even be allowed to do so, in
adjusting back-sights. He would, if he were
properly instructed, when within 300 yards
place his back-sight level, and rely upon
his own skill in judging what elevation he
should use.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>
<p>It is better to fire low than high. A low shot
will usually ricochet, particularly upon
striking hard ground, greensward, or a wet
clay soil, and, consequently, will do damage.
Very nearly two thirds of the bullets in
action are lost by going over the heads of
the enemy.</p>

<p>In the instruction of men in the use of the
rifle valuable time is wasted, and too much
importance is attached to useless detail. Let
a man be placed before the ordinary regimental
target, at an unknown distance, with
the figure of a man traced thereon, assuming
the target to be an enemy similarly armed
with himself; let him understand that he
must take his chance of hitting his man or
being hit himself; and let him fire at this
target with the back-sight level, judging his
own distance and the necessary elevation required:
this calculation (not a very difficult
one, after a little practice) could easily be
come to while in the act of loading. The
result of the first shot would determine the
required elevation, and by taking pains, bull's
eyes and centres would soon be obtained.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>It is submitted that this mode of procedure
would create an interest in the practice of the
soldier, tending to cause a healthy reaction;
men would take more pains, and try to beat
their comrades, as there would be a greater
stimulus to do so than by the present system.
Men, as it is, go to their practice without
the slightest interest therein, and get rid of
the ammunition as soon as possible, in order
to get off duty. The real reason why we
have such excellent shots in the Volunteers
is accounted for by the fact that they not
only take an interest in the work, but take
pains in everything they do, the result being
success.</p>

<p>Much significance is attached to the bull's-eye
mania. It should be borne in mind that
a man is a large object at which to aim; that
so long as he can be crippled there is no necessity
to kill. To disable a man so that he
can do no more mischief is sufficient.</p>

<p>Any man can make a scale of elevation in
his own mind, and, with practice, fire at any
range without putting up the sight, and can
fire standing. My theory is as follows:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>Up to 100 yards the range is point-blank,
that is, aim direct on the bull's eye; for 200
yards, raise the muzzle, say one foot above
the bull's eye; for 300 yards, two feet above
the bull's eye, and so on. A few trial-shots
will soon settle the question, and practice
makes perfect. A man will thus be independent
of the back-sight of his rifle. This
refers to shooting in the open. Of course,
under cover, when time and circumstances
admit, the back-sight can be used with great
advantage.</p>

<p>A man in shooting with a pistol or revolver
has to judge his own distance and the necessary
elevation. Why should not the same
rule apply directly to the rifle? I have seen
excellent practice at 400 yards with a Snider
carbine, back-sight level, the man judging his
own elevation, and have been very successful
myself, and have found the above rule apply,
with slight variations.</p>

<p>In rifle contests all artificial nonsense, such
as coloured glasses, eye-shades, kneeling upon
eider-down quilts, firing from shaded tents,
blackening sights, &amp;c., should be discouraged.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
Let a man leave all such effeminacy and tomfoolery
at home, and shoot like a man, taking
circumstances as he would find them in the
open field <i>with an enemy</i> before him, using
such cover only as nature and circumstances
provide.</p>

<p>There is infinite satisfaction attached to the
winning of an honour, when that honour has
to be obtained under difficulties which must
be surmounted. The more difficult the task
is, the more merit in overcoming it.</p>

<p>Lastly. All firearms require constant attention,
and should be kept clean. After use they
should be immediately attended to, and never
put away dirty; should be kept in some dry
corner where rust cannot destroy, and they
should be occasionally overhauled and oiled
when necessary. Really valuable weapons
are sometimes ruined by neglect. The man
who takes no pride in his gun is no sportsman.<br /><br /><br /></p>
